Hello! 
My name is Jashish and this is a repo I created for my submission for Software Developer Candidate Exercise.

### Objective
Where my tasks are to create a class capable of:
- Retrieving **mean response times** of all requests the object has processed for each separate URI, in millisecond units.
- Retrieving **standard deviation for the response times** of all requests the object has processed for each separate URI, in millisecond units.
- Retrieving **normalized histogram for the response times** of all requests the object has processed for each separate URI,
  - **Max bins** provided during object instantiation. Actual bins must be as close to max bins value as possible
  - **All response times** must be captured in Histogram
  - Must contain **no empty bin at edges**

### Unit testing commands:
